# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project.

#### During this project I worked with gmaps and APIs to implement some improvments to a app that showed users locations there desired locations based on inputs provided by the user. After the beginning trial we needed to make some changes to the application. 

###### It was suggested we added the following: 
- adding the weather description to the weather data we have previously retreieved.
- have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, 
  which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
- After the user picks four desired locations from the list, we will use these chosen cities for a travel itinerary.
- We achieved this by using Google Maps Directions API, because we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Our Final result
